    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Numbers:
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100

    age = 200; 
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    // Strings:
    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Wes Wes
    
    name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(name, name2) // Wes wesley

   // Let's say we have an array
   const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); 
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lex';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team); // Lex is now in the 3rd index
    console.log(players); // But... so is the original!

    // IF YOU UPDATE AN ARRAY, THEN IT WILL ALWAYS REFERENCE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
   
   // 1) SLICE METHOD
    const team2 = players.slice(); // pass nothing and you get a copy of the original array 
    
    // 2) CONCAT METHOD
    const team3= [].concat(players);
    
    // 3) ES6 SPREAD METHOD
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(team4);
    team4[3]="Steven";
    console.log(team4, players);

    // 4) ARRAY.FROM() METHOD
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);
    
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {"favorite color": "yellow"});
    console.log(person2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
